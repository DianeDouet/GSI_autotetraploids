# Autopolyploid establishment under gametophytic self-incompatibility

This repository contains the codes used for the simulations of the paper: "Autopolyploid establishment under gametophytic self-incompatibility: the impact of self-fertilization and pollen limitation".

Each python file corresponds to a variant of the model presented in the article:
- Code_neutralModel: Simulations for the neutral model, where individuals are only identified by their ploid level (no S-genoytpe, no fitness).
- Code_GSI_LimitPollen: Simulations for the GSI model where the sefling rate is fixed for the entire population. The individuals are defined by their ploidy level, their S-genotype and their fitness loci.
- Code_GSI_LimitPollen_SRevo: Simulatons for the GSI model where the selfing rate of each individual is allowed to evolve.
